Chapter One: The Diner

It started with a thesis crisis.
I was a final-year Architecture student, fueled entirely by panic and cheap espresso. It was 3:15 AM on a Tuesday in 2021, and I was sitting in The Greasy Spoon, a 24-hour diner that smelled permanently of bacon grease and despair. I was surrounded by a fortress of textbooks on Brutalism and urban decay.

The bell above the door jingled, and a guy walked in. He looked exactly how I felt: completely drained. He was wearing an oversized hoodie with the hood pulled up, generic jeans, and he kept his head down, avoiding eye contact with the sleepy waitress.

He sat three booths away, ordered a vanilla milkshake, and stared at his phone like it was a bomb he was trying to defuse.

Ten minutes later, disaster struck. My screen dimmed. My laptop charger had died.

I scrambled under the table, checking the outlet. Dead. I looked around frantically. The diner was empty except for me, the sleeping waitress, and Hood Guy. And, of course, the only working outlet with a green light was directly under his table.

I took a deep breath, grabbed my plug, and marched over.

"I am so sorry," I said, crouching near his booth, holding my plug up like a peace offering. "Do you mind? If my laptop dies, I’ll fail my major, and I’ll have to live in my crappy flat inside this dinner forever."

He looked up.

The first thing I noticed were his eyes. They were piercing blue, startlingly awake compared to the rest of him. He blinked, looking at me, then at the plug, then back at me. He shrugged.

"Go ahead," he said. His voice was raspy. "I don't want you to live here. The food is bad."

His accent was hard to place—definite European, blunt, a little hoarse.

"I’m Eleanor," I said, diving under his table to plug it in. "You can call me Ell."

"Franz," he replied.

I emerged from under the table and sat opposite him, just for a second, to make sure the charge was holding. "Thanks, Franz. You're a lifesaver. You studying too?"

"No," he said, stirring his milkshake. "Just... escaping."

"Work?"

"Something like that."

We ended up talking until 5 AM.

I complained about the cost of heating my drafty student house and the structural impossibility of my roommate Noah’s lasagna. He listened with a strange intensity, as if my complaints about utility bills were the most fascinating thing he’d heard all week.

He complained about "travel fatigue."

"I miss my cats," he said suddenly, showing me a picture on his phone. They were Bengal cats. They looked expensive.

"They're cute," I said. "So, what do you do? That keeps you away from the cats?"

He hesitated. Just for a fraction of a second.

"Logistics," he said. "High-performance logistics."

"Like... Amazon?"

"No," he cracked a small smile. "Faster. Moving sensitive cargo across borders. Strict deadlines. If I am late, people get very angry. It is... high pressure."

"Sounds intense," I yawned, packing up my books. "Well, Franz from Logistics, thanks for the electricity."

I thought he was a truck driver, or maybe a shift manager for a shipping company. I didn't ask. I just liked that he didn't ask me for anything.

He didn't ask for my number. He didn't ask what I was doing later. He just drank his milkshake and let me vent. Well, eventually he did ask for my number, and I gave it to him, you know incase things get serious.

      Chapter Two: The Aerodynamics of a Toast
      
Three months later, Max had become a fixture in my life. A weird, intermittent fixture.
      
He traveled constantly. He’d disappear for four days to "Italy" or "Japan" or "Miami" for work, texting me complaints about customs and jet lag. Then, he’d reappear in London, showing up at my student house with expensive takeout and a desperate need to sit on my lumpy sofa and do absolutely nothing.
      
My roommate, Noah, was skeptical at first. Noah is a Mechanical Engineering student who spent his spare time taking appliances apart and failing to put them back together. 
      
It was a Sunday afternoon. It was raining. Max was lying on the floor of our living room, staring at the ceiling. I was typing furiously at the table. Noah was surrounded by papers, looking like he was about to cry. 
      
"I don't get it," Noah groaned, slamming his pencil down. "The drag coefficient on this theoretical model is impossible. If I increase the angle of attack here, the turbulence destroys the rear stability." 
      
Max didn't move, but I saw his eyes shift. 
      
"What are you working on?" Max asked. 
      
"Aerodynamics assignment," Noah grumbled. "Designing a wing for a high-speed vehicle. But the airflow separation is a nightmare." 
      
Max sat up. He crawled over to where Noah was sitting and looked at the diagram. 
      
"Your endplate is too simple," Max said bluntly. 
      
Noah blinked. "Excuse me?" 
      
"The air," Max gestured with his hands, making swooping motions. "You are trying to force it over the top. You need to wash it out. Push the dirty air away from the body, or you lose the... the grip at the back." 
      
Noah frowned, adjusting his glasses. "Mate, you work in logistics. You move boxes. This is bosh." 
      
"I move fast boxes," Max said, his face dead serious. "And I know that if you put the angle like this, the car—I mean, the vehicle—will spin." 
      
"It's fluid dynamics, mate," Noah said condescendingly. "It's math. Not packing tape." 
      
"The math is wrong," Max insisted. He grabbed Noah's pencil. "Look. You need a vortex generator here. To seal the floor." 
      
"Seal the floor?" Noah laughed. "What are you talking about? It's a wing, not a vacuum cleaner."
      
I watched them from the table. Max looked frustrated. His hand was shaking slightly, hovering over the paper like he wanted to redraw the whole thing. He looked like he was physically restraining himself from giving a lecture. 
      
"Just trust me," Max muttered, dropping the pencil. "Flatten the angle. Open the side. It will work." 
      
"Right," Noah said, rolling his eyes. "I'll take advice from the guy who didn't know how to use the toaster last week." 

Franz slumped back against the sofa, crossing his arms. "Fine. Crash. See if I care."

"Nobody is crashing, mate. It's a diagram."

Two weeks later, the crash actually happened. But not to Noah’s diagram.

It was a Sunday, and our house was plunged into the dark ages because the WiFi router had finally given up the ghost.

"Fix it," I told Noah.

"I can’t," Noah said, lying on the floor. "It’s a hardware issue. The silicon soul has left the casing. We have to go out."

I had a 5,000-word chapter due on Monday morning. So, against my better judgment, we packed our bags and trudged down to The King’s Head, the only pub within walking distance that didn't smell entirely of mildew and had free WiFi.

The pub was packed. I managed to secure a sticky corner table while Noah went to get drinks. I put my noise-canceling headphones on, opened my laptop, and tried to ignore the fact that the entire room was screaming at the television screens mounted on the walls.

"Ell," Noah said, sliding a coke across the table. He didn't sit down. He was standing, staring over my head at the screen behind me.

"I am working, Noah. Do not disturb the genius."

"Ell," he said again. His voice was weird. Strained. "Look at the TV."

"I don't care about football."

"It’s not football. It’s... motor racing. I think."

"Good for them. Do they drive in circles?" I typed a sentence about urban density.

"Ell, please." Noah grabbed my shoulder. "Just look. Tell me I’m crazy. Tell me that isn't who I think it is."

I sighed, ripped my headphones off, and spun around in my chair.

The screen was massive. It was showing a podium ceremony. Confetti was raining down. The Dutch national anthem was blaring out of the pub speakers.

Standing on the top step of the podium, holding a gold trophy that was roughly the size of a small child, was a man in a blue racing suit. He was drenched in sweat and champagne. He was grinning, waving at a crowd of thousands.

I squinted.

The camera zoomed in on his face. The piercing blue eyes. The nose. The slight sunburn on his cheeks that he always complained about getting.

The man on the screen laughed and sprayed champagne over the guy standing next to him.

I felt the blood drain out of my body. The noise of the pub faded into a dull roar.

"That’s him isn’t it? The logistics guy," Noah whispered.

"It can't be," I said, my voice trembling. "Franz is... He is in France. Moving crates. He texted me this morning about a delayed lorry."

"That is Franz, or at least he was. You know what this means, right, Ell? That logistics guy had been lying to us!" Noah said, pointing a shaking finger at the screen.

The chyron beneath the man’s face flashed in bold white letters:

MAX VERSTAPPEN — WINNER — MONACO GRAND PRIX

"Verstappen?" I read the name out loud. It felt foreign. Heavy. My jaw clenched. So did my fingers.

"He’s not a logistics manager," Noah said, his voice rising in hysteria. "Ell. He’s an F1 Driver. He’s... he’s the guy I told to fix his endplates." Noah grabbed his hair. "I explained aerodynamics to Max Verstappen. Oh my god. I need a drink. I need a stronger drink."

I didn't move. I stared at the screen as Max—my Max, the guy who wore holes in his socks and ate my yogurt—hoisted the trophy high above his head.

He looked like a god. He looked untouchable.

And he looked like the biggest liar in the history of the universe.

I slowly closed my laptop.

"Noah," I said, my voice deadly calm. "Let’s go back home. I’ve got a logistics manager to kill with a scale ruler."
